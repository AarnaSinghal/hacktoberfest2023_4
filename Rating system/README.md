## Introduction

A well-designed product rating and review system is crucial for consumers when making informed decisions about purchasing products. This project aims to create a system that allows users to:

- Rate products on a scale.
- Write detailed reviews with text and multimedia content.
- View the average rating and read reviews.
- Sort and filter reviews based on various criteria.

By contributing to this project, you can help enhance the functionality, user experience, and scalability of this product rating system.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers with various skills and backgrounds. Whether you're a front-end developer, back-end developer, UX designer, or have other relevant expertise, you can contribute in different ways:

1. **Front-end Development:** Implement user interfaces, improve the user experience, and style the web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Back-end Development:** Develop the server-side logic using PHP, integrate the database, and handle user authentication and authorization.

3. **Database Management:** Design and optimize the database structure, create SQL scripts, and ensure data consistency.

4. **Documentation:** Improve the project's README, provide clear setup instructions, and document the codebase.

5. **Testing:** Test the system, find and report bugs, and ensure that the system works smoothly.

6. **Feature Development:** Add new features, such as user profiles, search functionality, or integration with external services.
