# Contributing to Hacktoberfest2023

Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages people to contribute to open-source projects. This year, it runs from October 1st to October 31st.

If you're new to open source, or just looking for a way to get involved, Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to do so. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Find an open-source project that you're interested in and see if they have any issues labeled "Hacktoberfest". If so, start working on those!

- If you can't find any Hacktoberfest issues, try looking for other issues that you can help with.

- Create your own.
