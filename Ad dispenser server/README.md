## Introduction

The Ad Dispenser Server is a backend system designed to manage and deliver advertisements to clients. It stores information about advertisements, such as their content, target audience, and performance statistics, in a database. Clients can request ads, and the server responds with appropriate ads based on various criteria.

## Getting Started

Before you can contribute to this project, you'll need to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

1. **Web Server**: You'll need a web server environment like Apache or Nginx to host and run the PHP scripts.
2. **PHP**: Ensure you have PHP installed on your system. You can check by running `php -v` in your terminal.
3. **Database Management System (DBMS)**: You can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any other DBMS of your choice.
4. **Git**: If you haven't already, install Git for version control.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ad-dispenser-server.git
   ```

2. Configure your web server to serve the project directory (e.g., configure Apache's virtual host or Nginx server block).
3. Create a new database and import the schema provided in the `database` directory using your DBMS.
4. Update the database connection settings in the `config.php` file with your database credentials.

Now you should have the project up and running locally.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `assets/`: Contains CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.
- `database/`: Contains SQL schema files for setting up the database.
- `php/`: Contains PHP scripts for handling ad requests, database interactions, and more.
