## Introduction

The Movie Recommendation Web App is an exciting project that aims to provide users with movie recommendations tailored to their preferences. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for server-side scripting, and a database for storing user preferences and movie information.

Our goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing web application that allows users to:

- Sign up and log in to their accounts.
- Rate and review movies they have watched.
- Receive personalized movie recommendations based on their ratings and reviews.
- Search for movies by title, genre, or actors.
- Explore movie details, including cast, plot summaries, and ratings.

By contributing to this project, you'll have the opportunity to work on various aspects of web development, from designing the user interface to implementing recommendation algorithms and database management.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers of all levels of experience. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer, there are several ways to contribute:

1. **Frontend Development:** Work on the user interface (HTML, CSS) to make the web app visually appealing and user-friendly.

2. **Backend Development:** Implement server-side logic using PHP, handle user authentication, and manage movie data.

3. **Database Management:** Help design and maintain the database schema for storing user data, movie information, and ratings.

4. **Recommendation Algorithms:** Implement recommendation algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences.

5. **Bug Fixes and Testing:** Identify and fix bugs, perform testing, and ensure the web app functions smoothly.
