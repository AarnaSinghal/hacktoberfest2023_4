## Project Overview

The Online Shopping Project is a web-based application that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase products online. It includes features such as user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and order management. The project is a great opportunity to learn and collaborate on building a real-world e-commerce platform.

**Key Technologies Used:**
- HTML: For structuring web pages.
- CSS: For styling and layout.
- JavaScript: For interactive features and user experience.
- PHP: For server-side logic and database interaction.
- DBMS: The database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing product and user information.
