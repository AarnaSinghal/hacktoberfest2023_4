# Automatic Timetable Creation in PHP

Welcome to the Automatic Timetable Creation project repository! This project aims to simplify the process of creating timetables for schools, colleges, or any organization that requires a structured schedule. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), PHP, and a Database Management System (DBMS) to achieve this goal. We invite you to contribute to this project and make it even better.

## Project Overview

Creating timetables manually can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. This project aims to automate the process by allowing users to input their scheduling preferences, and then generating an optimized timetable based on those preferences. The web application provides an intuitive user interface to streamline the scheduling process.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their scheduling preferences, such as class timings, subjects, and teacher availability.

- **Automatic Generation:** The system automatically generates a timetable based on the user's preferences, taking into account constraints like teacher availability, room capacity, and subject requirements.

- **Customization:** Users can customize the generated timetable to make adjustments or accommodate special events or holidays.

- **Export and Printing:** Timetables can be exported in various formats (e.g., PDF or CSV) for easy printing and sharing.

- **User Authentication:** For added security, user authentication can be implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify the timetable.
