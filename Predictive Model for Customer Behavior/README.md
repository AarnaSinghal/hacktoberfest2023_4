## Introduction

Understanding and predicting customer behavior is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions. This project focuses on building a predictive model that can help businesses anticipate customer actions, such as purchases, engagement, or churn.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-customer-behavior.git
   ```

2. **Setup the Environment:** Make sure you have the required technologies installed:

   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend.
   - PHP for server-side scripting.
   - A DBMS of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage.

3. **Configure Database:** Set up your chosen DBMS and create the necessary tables for storing customer data. You can find the database schema in the `database/` directory.

4. **Implement the Model:** Develop and implement the predictive model in the `src/` directory. You can use various machine learning libraries and techniques to create your predictive model.

5. **Build the Frontend:** Design and build the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend files can be found in the `public/` directory.

6. **Connect Backend and Frontend:** Use PHP to create API endpoints that interact with the database and serve data to the frontend.

7. **Test and Validate:** Thoroughly test your model and ensure that it provides accurate predictions.

8. **Documentation:** Document your code and any additional setup or usage instructions.

9. **Contributions:** Commit your changes, push to your forked repository, and submit a pull request to the main repository.
